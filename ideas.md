## Capabilities
* Add cocktail recipe
* Update cocktail recipe with rating, tried
* Mark ingredients as "owned"
* Search by ingredient
* Search by number of ingredients owned in recipe


## Longer term goals
* How to manage the input of ingredients? DO so string matching to see if the names match to add references... otherwise, prompt user for "best guess" or request they add a new ingredient.
